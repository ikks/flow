# Flow Control: a programmer's text editor

This is my Zig text editor. It is under active development, but very stable
and is my daily driver for almost everything.

[![Announcement](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iwPg3sIxMGw/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwPg3sIxMGw)


# Features

- **Lightning Fast** TUI with â‰¤6ms frame times, **low latency** input handling
  and smooth **animated scrolling**
- Intuitive UI with **tabs**, **scrollbars** and **palettes** with full
  **mouse** support for all UI elements
- Support for more than **70 programming languages**, **zero
  configuration** needed, via **tree-sitter** powered syntax highlighting
- **Language Server Protocol** pre configured support for most language servers
- Powerful **multi-cursor** editing and integrated **clipboard history**
- Powerful configurable keybinding system that supports **modal** and
  **non-modal** editing styles
- Multiple pre-configured **keybinding modes**
    - Flow Control - GUI IDE style bindings (similar to vscode)
    - Emacs
    - Vim
    - Helix
    - User created
- Hybrid rope/piece-table buffer system, edit **very large files** with
  **thousands of cursors**
- Infinite **undo** (at least until you run out of ram)
- Full **unicode** support, including support for the kitty text sizing protocol
- Plenty of **themes** included and support for vscode themes via the
  flow-themes project
- Runs on **Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS, Windows and Android** (under termux) with
  easy **cross-compilation** to all supported targets


# Requirements

- A modern terminal with **24bit color** and, ideally, **kitty keyboard
  protocol** support. **Kitty**, **Foot** and **Ghostty** are the recommended
  terminals at this time. **Zellij** also works well. Most other terminals will
  work, but likely with reduced functionality.
- **NerdFont** support. Either via terminal font fallback or a patched font.
- A **UTF-8** locale


# Roadmap

See our [devlog](/devlog/2025) for on-going updates from the development team.

## In Development

- LSP completion support
- Persistent undo/redo
- File watcher integration

## Future

- Collaborative editing
- Plugin system
- Multi-terminal sessions


# Download / Install

There is an [installation guide](https://flow-control.dev/installation) on the
main website, and source, release and nightly build binary
[downloads](https://flow-control.dev/downloads).

Or check your favorite local system package repository.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/flow-control.svg)](https://repology.org/project/flow-control/versions)


# Building

Make sure your system meets the requirements listed above.

Flow builds with zig 0.15.2 at this time. Build with:

```shell
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

Zig will by default build a binary optimized for your specific CPU. If you get
illegal instruction errors add `-Dcpu=baseline` to the build command to produce
a binary with generic CPU support.


Thanks to Zig you may also cross-compile from any host to pretty much any
target. For example:

```shell
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -Dtarget=x86_64-windows --prefix zig-out/x86_64-windows
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -Dtarget=x86_64-macos-none --prefix zig-out/x86_64-macos
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -Dtarget=aarch64-linux-musl --prefix zig-out/aarch64-linux
```

When cross-compiling zig will build a binary with generic CPU support.


The output binary is:

```
zig-out/bin/flow
```

It is statically built (by default) and contains all the required tree-sitter parsers
and queries. No additional runtime files are required.


# Running Flow Control

The Flow Control binary is called `flow`.

Place it in your path for convenient access:

```shell
sudo cp zig-out/bin/flow /usr/local/bin
```

Or if you prefer, let zig install it in your home directory:

```shell
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix ~/.local
```

Flow Control is a single statically linked binary. No further runtime files are
required. You may install it on another system by simply copying the binary.

```shell
scp zig-out/bin/flow root@otherhost:/usr/local/bin
```

Files to load may be specifed on the command line:

```shell
flow fileA.zig fileB.zig
```

The last file will be opened and the previous files will be placed in reverse
order at the top of the recent files list. Switch to recent files with Ctrl-e.

Common target line specifiers are supported too:

```shell
flow file.txt:123
```

Or Vim style:

```shell
flow file.txt +123
```

Use the --language option to force the file type of a file:

```shell
flow --language bash ~/.bash_profile
```

Show supported language names with `--list-languages`.

See `flow --help` for the full list of command line options.


# Documentation

## User manual

A basic user manual is available inside flow. You can open it with the
`Open help` command (F1).

It is also available in the website [documentation](https://flow-control.dev/docs/)
section.

## Development Resources

Additional [developer](https://flow-control.dev/docs/#resources) resources can
be found on the Flow Control website at.

There is also an AI generated developer guide at
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/neurocyte/flow).
Accuracy may vary. Check details against the referenced source code.


# Configuration

Configuration is mostly dynamically maintained with various commands in the UI.
It is stored under the standard user configuration path. Usually
`~/.config/flow` on Linux. %APPDATA%\Roaming\flow on Windows. Somewhere magical
on MacOS.

There are commands to open the various configuration files, so you don't have to
manually find them. Look for commands starting with `Edit` in the command
palette.

File types may be configured with the `Edit file type configuration` command.
You can also create a new file type by adding a new `.conf` file to the
`file_type` directory. Have a look at an existing file type to see what options
are available.

Logs, traces and per-project most recently used file lists are stored in the
standard user application state directory. Usually `~/.local/state/flow` on
Linux and %APPDATA%\Roaming\flow on Windows.


# Key bindings and commands

Press `F1` to view the online manual.
Press `F4` to switch the current keybinding mode. (flow, vim, emacs, etc.)
Press `ctrl+shift+p` or `alt+x` to show the command palette.
Press `ctrl+F2` to see a full list of all current keybindings and commands.

Run the `Edit keybindings` command to save the current keybinding mode to a
file and open it for editing. Save your customized keybinds under a new name
in the same directory to create an entirely new keybinding mode. Keybinding
changes will take effect on restart.


# Terminal configuration

Kitty, Ghostty and most other terminals have default keybindings that conflict
with common editor commands. I highly recommend rebinding them to keys that are
not generally used anywhere else.

For Kitty rebinding `kitty_mod` is usually enough:
```
kitty_mod ctrl+alt
```

For Ghostty each conflicting binding has to be reconfigured individually.
